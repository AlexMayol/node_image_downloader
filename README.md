# node_image_downloader
A basic image downloader via HTTP

Photobucket is no longer a free hosting site, so I decided to bulk-download all the images I stored there for almost 15 years.

This is just a good practice to learn how async Node works with files and HTTP requests, so it's still a huge WIP :)
